I can't believe I just finished up my second project.  For my Sinatra Portfolio Project, I created the app Travel Log.  Travel Log is a Sinatra CRUD app that allows users to keep track of the destinations they have visited and the activities they did at each destination. Each user is only able to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) their own content. 

Going into this project I definitely felt more comfortable than I had going into creating my Shoe Watch CLI App. That being said, I did not find this project to be easier, I just had a better understanding of the process and what I needed to get done. I found this project to be more challenging just because there were more components to it. Before I began coding my app, I attended a Sinatra Portfolio Project lecture that walked through how to start the project and what is expected. I took a look at the examples given during the lecture and on the Sinatra Portfolio Project page, along with previous labs, to figure out what I wanted to create and its structure.  Once I landed on this idea of creating Travel Log, I took some time to map out the models and tables in my notebook to visualize the structure. Once I coded my models and tables, I started on my controllers, their routes, and respective views one at a time. I looked at the examples and my previous labs to figure out what each of the controllers needed. Once the controllers and the views were created, I ran shotgun to see how everything interacted and what it looked like in the browser. From there, I mostly worked out my kinks by identifying the issues through shotgun. This is where I noticed issues with my users, data not showing up in the browser, relationships between models, and other various things. This troubleshooting process was a wonderful learning experience because it made me truly understand how everything is working together in my program. Although the projects will just get harder, I am excited for the next one because I know I will walk away feeling more confident in my skills and knowledge due to the project process.
