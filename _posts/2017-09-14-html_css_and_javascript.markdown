Understanding the functions and differences of all the programming languages is part of the learning curve for becoming a web developer.  I have found that one of the most important aspects to learn about is how the languages interact with each other.  There are many languages out there, but I am going to give a brief overview of a few of the languages I have learned so far, which are HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

HTML stands for "Hypertext Markup Language."  Generally, a website should have an index.html file in your project folder for it.  The HTML is used to create the skeleton of the website.  All headers, paragraphs, images, titles, links, footers, etc. that go on a website are outlined using HTML.

CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheet."  After you put together the skeleton of your website with HTML, you can add files to your project folder for styling.  These files for styling will use the CSS language.  You use CSS to put creativity and pizzazz into a webpage by adding font styles, colors, padding, margins, backgrounds, borders, and numerous other styling properties to your HTML skeleton.

Javascript is an object-oriented programming language.  It is possible to have a website without Javascript or a different object-oriented programming language, but it would be very basic.  To compliment and add functionality to the HTML and CSS files, you can add a Javascript file.  In this Javascript file is where you program any dropdown menus, equations, quizzes, games, interactive images, slideshows, polls, etc.

After reading about the interactions that take place between the three languages above, you can see that it is possible to create a very basic website with just HTML, but in order to design a captivating website, you need to include CSS and Javascript.
