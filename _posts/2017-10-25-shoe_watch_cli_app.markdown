I just finished coding my Shoe Watch CLI App and I CANNOT wait to submit it for my review. This has been a huge learning experience for me, but I am very thankful for it. Having to create a CLI app from scratch was not an easy task. When I initially read through the requirements, I was very overwhelmed. After I came up with a possible idea for the app, I spent hours watching Avi's videos and looking through the code of the examples we were given.  I also looked through previous labs with code that related to the project. The first thing I did once I started the coding process was install the gem bundler to create my file tree skeleton. From there, I wrote out a summary of exactly how I wanted my program to work, although it evolved as I continued working on it.  My next step was to establish the relationships between the files to get them to interact with each other appropriately.  I then started to put code into my program. I used Nokogiri and Open-uri in for scraping websites. To refresh and learn a few more pointers, I watched youtube videos and read blog posts about scraping websites. I also used Pry to create my app. Pry helped me check if my methods and classes were interacting with each other properly and see what information I was scraping off of the websites.  After may hours of writing and rewriting code, watching videos, reading blog posts, and reviewing old labs, I created my first CLI App from scratch! 

Here is a brief summary of my Show Watch CLI App: The purpose of Shoe Watch is to show users new arrival shoes in different categories from the websites of Nike, Under Armour, and Saucony. Users are given basic information regarding each shoe presented to them, then they can choose to see more details. This simplifies the users online shopping experience. If a user's interest is sparked, then they can follow the URL to see that specific shoe or browse others on the respective brand's website.
