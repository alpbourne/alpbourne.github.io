After doing research, talking with peers, and starting to learn about code on my own, I decided I wanted to become a full stack web developer.  I understand that this is a huge challenge and undertaking, but I am ready for it. 

I decided on becoming a full stack web developer for a few reasons.  I started getting interested in web development because I have watched my brother become this spectacular web developer who gets to use his creativity and brain power to create amazing new ideas.  I am inspired by that and desire to have the skillset to do the same.  While doing my research, I found that the need for full stack web developers is high in the job market and will only continue to grow as technology advances.  Furthermore, the option of working remotely is extremely valuable to me since my husband and I have to move around often. 

I am excited to see where this career change adventure takes me. I look forward to becoming a successful full stack web developer by combining my creativity with the skills the Flatiron School teaches me.
