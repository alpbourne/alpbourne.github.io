For my final project I made an application called "The Persimmon Boutique." I was inspired by my Aunt to make a Boutique website. My Aunt owns an amazing lifestyle store, but does not have a website to match it. I went to visit her store one day and we got to catch up.   After I had caught her up on how my web developing studies were going, she mentioned to me that she needed a new website.  On the drive home, I decided I wanted to make a mock website for my final project that could be adjusted to fit her store's needs.  Right now her website is one page with basic information and barely has any styling, so I thought I could definitely do better than that for her. 

The Persimmon Boutique application is comprised of a Ruby on Rails backend API and a React-Redux frontend. I started the application by creating the database, models, and controllers in the backend. I found some boutique like pictures and then seeded some items and reviews in my database to play around with on the frontend.  The first thing I did on the frontend is create the home page that features items that can be found inside the Boutique. After I was happy with that styling, I created the reviews feature at the bottom of the home page. The reviews feature allows visiters to write and delete reviews for the Boutique. Those first two steps were tricky because that is where I had to pass around the state and props and make fetch calls to the API. That was a great learning experience for me. After those features were finished I added in the Router and Navbar. I added two more routes for an "About Us" and "Contact Us" section.

I believe The Persimmon Boutique application will be a great improvement for my Aunt's Store, but I am excited to still make some improvements to it. While I do not believe making a shopping cart is the next step because she doesn't want to process online orders right now, I do believe I will try to make a 'Wish List" feature next.
